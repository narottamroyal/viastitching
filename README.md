# Via Stitching

Via Stitching action-plugin for use with KiCad 6.0+.  
Fills a selected copper area with a pattern of vias.

## Description

This plugin can fill copper areas with vias to improve thermal conduction, tie different layers together, or reduce resistance/inductance between layers.
The plugin relies on pre-existing areas, so you must define and select an area before starting the plugin.

## Usage

 - Select the area you want to fill
 - Click on the ![AddNet icon](viastitching.png?raw=true) toolbar icon or select `Tools` → `External Plugins` → `ViaStitching`
 - The following window should appear:

![via stitching window](images/via-stitching-window.png) 

The plugin provides the following options:
- Net Name: allows you to change the net associated with the vias (defaults to the net associated with the target area)
- Via Pattern: allows you to select between grid and star via patterns
  - Grid: generates vias in a uniform grid (default)
  - Star: offsets every second row by half the grid spacing
- Via:
  - Size: sets the outer diameter of the vias (uses the current via size by default)
  - Drill: sets the drill/hole size of the vias (uses the current via size by default)
- Spacing:
  - X: sets the horizontal via spacing (defaults to double the via size)
  - Y: sets the vertical via spacing (defaults to double the via size)
- Offset (useful for aligning the via pattern by shifting all the vias):
  - X: offsets the via pattern from the left (0 by default)
  - Y: offsets the via pattern from the top (0 by default)
- Clearance:
  - Edge: sets the clearance from the edge of the target area (0 by default)  
  Note that a value of 0 disables clearance checking
  - Track: sets the clearance from all tracks (uses the largest clearance by default)
- Operations:
  - Fill: fills the target area with vias (default)
  - Clear: removes vias generated by this plugin (this is currently the best way to undo the via stitching)
    - Remove all vias: if checked, all vias associated with the target area will be removed

When you're satisfied with the settings, select __Ok__ and the vias will be generated or removed (depending on whether __Fill__  or __Clear__ was selected).
If everything goes well, you should see something like this:

![via stitching grid pattern](images/via-stitching-grid-pattern.png)
![via stitching star pattern](images/via-stitching-star-pattern.png)

After stitching, it is always a good idea to run the DRC since some vias may overlap with other PCB elements or violate other design rules. It is currently up to the user to remove conflicting vias.
In future releases, the via generation process will prevent vias from overlapping with other elements.

## TODO

Some features still to code:
- [x] Match user units (mm/inches).
- [x] Add clear area function.
- [ ] Draw a better UI (if anyone is willing to contribute, please read the following section).
- [x] Collision between new vias and underlying objects: 
   - [x] tracks
   - [x] zones
   - [x] pads
   - [x] modules
   - [x] vias
- [ ] Different fillup patterns/modes (bounding box, centered spiral).
- [x] Avoid placing vias near area edges (define clearance).
- [ ] History management (board commit).
- [ ] Localization.
- [ ] Any request?

## Coding notes

If you are willing to modify the GUI (you're welcome) through __wxFormBuilder__ (```viastitching.fbp``` file) remember to modify this line (around line 25 ```viastitching_gui.py```):
```
self.SetSizeHints( wx.DefaultSize, wx.DefaultSize )
```
In this way:
```
if sys.version_info[0] == 2:
 self.SetSizeHintsSz( wx.DefaultSize, wx.DefaultSize )
else:
 self.SetSizeHints( wx.DefaultSize, wx.DefaultSize )
```
This modification allows the code to work with __Python 2__ as well as __Python 3__, please note that you need to ```import sys```. Special thanks to *NilujePerchut* for this hint.

## kicad-action-scripts - ViaStitching plugin similarity

Yes, my plugin is pretty similar to this plugin, but I'm using a radically different approach in coding. At the time I wrote the first release of my plugin unluckly __jsreynaud__'s plugin wasn't working but I bet he will fix it.

## Greetings

I hope someone finds my work useful or at least provides *inspiration* to create something else/better.
I would like to thank everyone who has shared their knowledge of Python and KiCad with me: Thanks!

Live long and prosper!

That's all folks.
